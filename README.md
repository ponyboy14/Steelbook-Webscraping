# Steelbook-Webscraping
## Overview
This project was created to further my knowledge of python and its libraries. I chose to scrape the data about steelbooks due to my growing collection of those.

## Objectives
1. Scrape the data from various websites that sell steelbooks.
2. Print just the name of the steelbook and the price from the data
3. Eventually create a sorting method to have the prices display cheapest to most expensive.

## Running the Code
- For this code, you simply just need to run it and the code will do everything by itself.

## Future Goals
- Add in a sorting method (Most likely a radix sort).
- Speed up the scraping process.
- Possibly allow the user to seach for an item instead of limiting to steelbooks.
